# Tic Tac Toe

## This project is supposed to help me understand objects 

So far all the code is written without using objects. I will focus this next week on using objects to have as little global code as possible

Hint: One of something like gameboard or display controller use module vs multiples of something like players i will use factory

Future Steps: I will have the computer make moves for O and using the [minmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to make it unbeatable
